# Robot Design and Competition

Welcome to the repository for the Robot Design and Competition project! This repository contains all the information, code, and resources related to the design and implementation of a virtual and physical robot for various tasks.

## Overview

This project consists of two main tasks: Simulation and Physical Tasks. The tasks involve a series of challenges that the robot must complete, showcasing its capabilities in navigation, decision-making, and interaction with the environment.

### Simulation Task

In the simulation task, the robot is designed and tested within the Webots Open-Source Simulator (Version R2021b). The tasks include:

- Line Following
- Segmented Wall Following
- Dotted Line Following
- Chess Board Arena Challenge

The highlight of this task is the chess board challenge, where the robot must place the black rook and  deliver checkmate the white king in one move to open a secret chamber.

### Physical Task

In the physical task, the real robot is deployed to complete a set of challenges. These challenges include:

- Line Maze Exploration
- Line Maze Speeding
- Curved Wall Following
- Blind Box Challenge

The physical task presents obstacles such as line maze navigation, precise wall following, and decision-making in the blind box challenge.

## Repository Structure

- `simulation/`: Contains code and resources for the simulation task.
- `physical/`: Contains code and resources for the physical task.
- `docs/`: Documentation and diagrams related to the project.
- `src/`: Source code for the robot's control and decision-making.
- `resources/`: Additional resources such as images and models.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/MB-Shihab-Aaqil-Ahamed/Robot-Design-and-Competition.git`
2. Navigate to the relevant task directories: `cd simulation` or `cd physical`
3. Follow the README files in each directory for detailed instructions on setting up and running the robot.

## Task Details
